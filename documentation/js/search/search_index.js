Challenge your mind to learn more and more as your career progresses. The ultimate goals of oneself should be reaching professional heights and discovering your boundaries over and over again.\nNow lets get to the good stuff...\nRunning the dev server\nThis is pretty straight forward since the defaults of ng new have not been altered. Just run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuilding the whole thing\nAs mentioned before, these also run by using the defaults of Angular. Simply run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nGithub Pages\nSince this app is deployable out of the box the Github Pages were used for convenience. To be able to add your fork of the project on Github Pages just npm install the angular-cli-ghpages package. Instructions on how to do so can be found here.\nDocumentation\nDocumentation about the app can be found in the documentation folder. Just open the index.html file inside the folder or after npm install run npm run compodoc and go to http://localhost:8080/\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma. The CLI should automatically launch the browser with the results if it doesn't head over to http://localhost:9876/ to see the results.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nNo e2e tests were written (yet).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Serhan Uygur\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
